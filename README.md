GNU GPL 3.  "Just Another Nodes Framework" for Blender

My goal is to implement something that works for me, the way I like it. I'm not seeking to please anyone or fullfil feature requests (but you are welcome to suggest them, i'm not closed to cool ideas).

This implementation focusses on experimentations with SuperCollider 3. Mapping Ugens to Nodes, allowing abstract tree types. Early days yet, hopefully this will become interesting.
